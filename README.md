"# CST8237-Lab-6" 
So yeah, I realize that this is super late. 
Mostly due to my condition making it hard for me to focus,
and not knowing where to start or what exactly I was looking at,
(my fault for not asking for the required lecture material when I missed class).
Hopefully I can at least demonstrate to you that I am taking your class seriously,
and that I am learning that which you are teaching.
Despite the anxiety associated with submitting something so late,
I had a alot of fun with this assignment.
